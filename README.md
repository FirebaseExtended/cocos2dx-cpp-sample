Introduction
------------

- [Read more about Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs)

Prerequisites
-------------

- The `setup_firebase_sample.py` script requires Python to be installed locally.
  Visit the [Python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  for more information.

- If you are running this script on a Mac, you will need CocoaPods installed.
  See the CocoaPods [Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)
  for more details.

Getting Started
---------------

- Clone the Firebase Cocos2d-x Samples GitHub repo.
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/firebase/cocos2dx-cpp-sample.git
  ```
- Navigate to the directory that you just cloned and run the Firebase setup
  script, where FIREBASE_FEATURE is one of the following:
  AdMob, Analytics, Auth, Invites, Messaging, Remote_Config
  ```
  python setup_firebase_sample.py FIREBASE_FEATURE
  ```
- If you haven't done so already, you will need to add the cocos2d-x environment
  variables to the operating system's PATH variable. Navigate to the
  `sample_project/cocos2d` directory and run the cocos2d-x setup script:
  ```
  python setup.py
  ```

### iOS
- Follow the steps in
  [Set up your app in Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cpp/setup#set_up_your_app_in_name_appmanager).
    - Bundle ID: org.cocos2dx.hellocpp
- Open the `sample_project/proj.ios_mac/HelloCpp.xcworkspace` with Xcode. From
  the Project Navigator, right click on `HelloCpp` and select “Add files to
  HelloCpp.” Find the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file that you downloaded in
  step 1 and click the Add button.
- In the top left corner, set the active scheme to HelloCpp-mobile and choose
  the device that you want to run the app on. Then, click the run button to
  build and run the app.

### Android
- Follow the steps in
  [Set up your app in Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cpp/setup#set_up_your_app_in_name_appmanager_1).
    - Package Name: org.cocos2dx.hellocpp
- Add the google-services.json file that you downloaded in step 1 to the
  `sample_project/proj.android-studio/app` directory.
- In the terminal from the `sample_project` directory, compile the Cocos project
  for Android:
  ```
  cocos compile -p android --ap ## --android-studio --app-abi armeabi-v7a
  ```
  Where `##` is the Android platform used for building the apk,
  for example, `android-22`.
- Open the `sample_project/proj.android-studio` project in Android Studio and
  run the app. To install the APK on a device, navigate to
  `sample_project/bin/debug/android`.
